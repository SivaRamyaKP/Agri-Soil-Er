Soil samples were collected and after processing soil pH were determined by using pH meter. Soil samples were analyzed for the 
present study and digital camera was used for capturing images (JPEGformat). This JPEG format of images was converted into img.
file for the purpose of digital value extraction and finally determined their digital values. Soil pH index value of each 
samples were analysed by using the following equation pH index = (Red/Green)/Blue. Equation values and measured soil pH values were 
correlated .Determination of soil pH was based on digital image processing technique, in which digital photographs ofthe soil samples were
used for the analysis of soil pH.
